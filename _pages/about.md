I am currently a MS research scholar in the [G S Sanyal School of Telecommunications](http://cse.iitkgp.ac.in/) at IIT Kharagpur, India. I am pursuing my MS. under the supervision of Prof. [Sandip Chakraborty](https://cse.iitkgp.ac.in/~sandipc/) and Prof. [Debarati Sen](https://cse.iitkgp.ac.in/~sandipc/). 
<!-- I am also a member of the research group [Ubiquitous Networked Systems Lab (UbiNet)](https://cse.iitkgp.ac.in/resgrp/ubinet/).  -->

<!-- Moreover, as a Visiting Postgraduate Research Student at the esteemed School of Computing and Information Systems at Singapore Management University ([SMU](https://www.smu.edu.sg/)), I am engaged in research work within the dynamic domain of the Human-Machine Collaborative Systems LAB, collaborating closely with [Prof. Archan Misra](https://sites.google.com/view/archan-misra) and [Prof. Thivya Kandappu
](https://faculty.smu.edu.sg/profile/thivya-kandappu-541). -->

My research interests include the areas of ubiquitous computing, ROS2, and JC&S on Cyber-Physical aerial systems etc.

Primary Research Experience
======
1. Experience with design of adavnced cyber physical aerial systems, control systems, RF communication devices assembly. Have hands-on-experience of developing UAV/UGV robotics systems.

1. Experience with UAV firmware customization. 

1. Experience with mmWave and acoustic FMCW signal processing techniques. I have used mmWave and accoustic FMCW  sensors for localization, tracking and mapping of indoor environments.
<!-- 1. Hands-on experience in hardware prototyping including circuit design, circuit debugging, deployment. Developed prototype hardwares for Embedded Pollution Sensors mounted on a drone for air quality assesment.  -->
<!-- 1. Experience conducting human research studies. Conducted real-time driver inattenviness study using COTS mmWave Radars by collecting doppler shifts in the mmWave data because of drivers attentive body movements, such as talking, yawning, nodding, etc.  -->

1. Experience with Computer Networks, IoT devices, Distributed Sensor Networks.
