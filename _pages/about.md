I am currently a MS research scholar in the [G S Sanyal School of Telecommunications](https://www.iitkgp.ac.in/department/GS) at [IIT Kharagpur](https://www.iitkgp.ac.in/), India. I am pursuing my MS. under the supervision of Prof. [Sandip Chakraborty](https://cse.iitkgp.ac.in/~sandipc/) and Prof. [Debarati Sen](https://sites.google.com/view/debarati-sen).I am also a member of the research group [Ubiquitous Networked Systems Lab (UbiNet)](https://cse.iitkgp.ac.in/resgrp/ubinet/). My research interests lie broadly in the fields of millimeter-wave sensing, FMCW radars, human-computer interaction (HCI), and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs).


Primary Research Experience
======
1. Experience with mmWave and acoustic FMCW signal processing techniques. I have used mmWave and accoustic FMCW sensors for 3d reconstruction, localization, tracking and activity recognition of humans under indoor environments.
1. Experience in end-to-end UAV/UGV system design using Pixhawk 6X flight controller, with robust interfacing of application-oriented subsystems for sensing, perception, navigation, and mission-specific autonomy. 
1. Hands-on experience in hardware prototyping and field deployment, including the design and development of embedded pollution-sensing hardware for air-quality assessment.

During my bachelor’s studies, I served as a Program Developer Intern at [UiT – The Arctic University of Norway](https://en.uit.no/startsida), Tromsø, as part of a joint collaboration between the [Centre for New Antibacterial Strategies (CANS)](https://uit.no/research/cans), led by [Prof. Christian S. Lentz](https://en.uit.no/ansatte/christian.s.lentz#:~:text=Christian%20Lentz%20is%20an%20Associate,of%20Health%20Sciences%20at%20UiT.), and the [Host–Microbe Interaction (HMI)](https://uit.no/research/hmi?p_document_id=764987&Baseurl=%2Fresearch%2F) research group, led by [Prof. Mona Johannessen](https://en.uit.no/ansatte/mona.johannessen). Under the supervision of [Jonathan Hira](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonathan-h-60592427/) and [Arif Ahmed](https://www.linkedin.com/in/arif1984/), my work involved developing a software framework for an embedded medical imaging system to perform real-time colony growth analysis and quantify antibacterial tolerance across heterogeneous bacterial populations.
