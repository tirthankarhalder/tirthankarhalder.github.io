I am currently a MS research scholar in the [G S Sanyal School of Telecommunications](http://cse.iitkgp.ac.in/) at IIT Kharagpur, India. I am pursuing my MS. under the supervision of Prof. [Sandip Chakraborty](https://cse.iitkgp.ac.in/~sandipc/) and Prof. [Debarati Sen](https://sites.google.com/view/debarati-sen).I am also a member of the research group [Ubiquitous Networked Systems Lab (UbiNet)](https://cse.iitkgp.ac.in/resgrp/ubinet/). My research interests lie broadly in the fields of millimeter-wave sensing, FMCW radars, human-computer interaction (HCI), and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs).


Primary Research Experience
======
1. Experience with mmWave and acoustic FMCW signal processing techniques. I have used mmWave and accoustic FMCW sensors for 3d reconstruction, localization, tracking and activity recognition of humans under indoor environments.
1. Experience in end-to-end UAV/UGV system design using Pixhawk 6X flight controller, with robust interfacing of application-oriented subsystems for sensing, perception, navigation, and mission-specific autonomy. 
1. Hands-on experience in hardware prototyping and field deployment, including the design and development of embedded pollution-sensing hardware for air-quality assessment.

During my bachelor’s studies, I served as a Program Developer Intern at [UiT – The Arctic University of Norway] (https://en.uit.no/startsida), Tromsø, as part of a joint collaboration between the Centre for New Antibacterial Strategies (CANS), led by Prof. Christian S. Lentz, and the Host–Microbe Interaction (HMI) research group, led by Prof. Mona Johannessen. Under the supervision of Jonathan Hira and Arif Ahmed, my work involved developing a software framework for an embedded medical imaging system to perform real-time colony growth analysis and quantify antibacterial tolerance across heterogeneous bacterial populations.
